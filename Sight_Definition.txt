	narrow vision for searching. 
	
	wideLooks- this is a wider coned vision that isnt long range (distance wise)
	
	narrowLooks- this is a more narrow vision but has a longer range for distance spotting 
	
	Both cover the different fov for the npc so it can see/search
	for the player

		of the wall infront of the npc, if the wall is <= 5 meters away or inside a building 
		then this activates.
 		Using a wider vision (which has a short range) the NPC checks for the player.
